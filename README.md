Linear Regression:
<hr>
<h1> Introduction to Linear Regression</h1>
In simple regression, we predict scores on one variable from the scores on a second variable.
The variable we are predicting is called Criterion, and is referred to as Y.<br>
The variable we are basing our prediction on is called the predictor variable and is referred to as X.<br><br>
When there is only one predictor variable the prediction method is called simple regression.
In simple linear regression, the topic of this section, the predictions of Y when plotted as a function of X from a straight line.<br>

As we know formula  of a line as : <Strong >Y = mx + c</strong><br>
<h3>Steps to procced</h3><br>
  1) find the mean of X and Y<br>
  2) find the slope(m) using the formula: <strong> m=summation of (x-X')*(y-Y')/summation of(x-x')**2</Strong><br>
  3) Now find the intersept(C) by putting the mean_X and mean_y in the line equation.<br>
  
  <h3>What is R-square?</h3>
  R-squared value is a statistical measure of how close the data are to be fitted regression line.
  It is also known as co-efficient of determination or the coefficient of multiple determination.<br>
  Higher the R-squared value, more efficient is the line of regression.<br>
  <Strong>Formula: R**2 = (summation(Yp - Y')**2)\(summation(Y - Y')**2)</strong>
