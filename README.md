<h1> Introduction to Linear Regression</h1>
In simple regression, we predict scores on one variable from the scores on a second variable.
The variable we are predicting is called Criterion, and is referred to as Y.<br>
The variable we are basing our prediction on is called the predictor variable and is referred to as X.<br>
When there is only one predictor variable the prediction method is called simple regression.
In simple linear regression, the topic of this section, the predictions of Y when plotted as a function of X from a straight line.
